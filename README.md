# Overview:

The purpose of this project is to develop a web application consisting of dynamically generated web pages by a server that stores and queries a database, without using any existing frameworks. The goal is to implement each process (e.g., database setup, schema scripting, seeding, etc.) while learning the detailed mechanisms behind them.

Ultimately, I will create a fully functional e-commerce web application integrated with the Stripe payment gateway. For example, in this app, users will be able to purchase products, and administrators will manage these products through a comprehensive dashboard. Administrators will be able to create, manage, and publish products.

The intention of this project is to gain familiarity with application servers and databases by understanding backend principles and developing my own micro-framework or reusable systems. In real-world scenarios, much of the work done in this project would typically be delegated to existing frameworks or development infrastructure to allow more focus on core business logic and services. However, all the software development concepts covered in this course will carry over to backend development work.
